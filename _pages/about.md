I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb, specializing in Explainable AI. My research focuses on [layer-wise relevance propagation, local attribution evaluation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3649458), [human-XAI alignment](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10569295), and [leveraging XAI for efficient model learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20268). Beyond academia, I have extensive industry experience applying machine learning across computer vision, natural language processing, graph processing, and time-series forecasting.
